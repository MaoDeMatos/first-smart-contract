# First test of smart contract

This is my first try to develop, build, test and deploy a smart contract locally.

I used Microsoft's Tutorial ([Get started with blockchain development](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/paths/ethereum-blockchain-development/), slightly out of date) to try and develop smart contracts written in Solidity, with the Ethereum protocol.

## Requirements

<!-- - python ^3.10.0 -->

- Node.js ^16.14.0
- Truffle
- Ganache CLI

## Commands

### `truffle compile`

Build the contracts.

### `truffle migrate`

Deploy the contracts.

### `truffle test`

Test the deployed contracts.
